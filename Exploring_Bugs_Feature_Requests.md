# Exploring the YoYoGames GitHub

All public GameMaker project repositories can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/YoYoGames as well as other information about GameMaker.

## Roadmap

The Roadmap lists the upcoming features going into GameMaker and the status of each of them. You can find it at: 

https://github.com/orgs/YoYoGames/projects/13

## Bugs & Feature Requests

You can find all bugs and feature requests in the https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues list.

Bug reports that you send from [The Help Menu](manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.htm)'s `Report a GameMaker Bug` option are also created in this list.

### Looking for an Existing Bug

When you want to report a bug or an issue with the manual, there is a chance that someone else already reported it. To check if this is the case, you can use GitHub's search bar at the top:

## Contributing Code and Documentation

You can contribute your own code to the public GameMaker repositories that you find here. These include the HTML5 runner repository, the extension repositories (starting with `GMEXT-`) and the manual repository.

To contribute code to a repository: 

1. Clone the project and make changes in a new branch or fork the project and make the changes there.
2. Create a pull request into the `main` branch with your changes for the development team to review.
3. If any changes to your pull request are required you will be asked to make them before the changes can be merged in.
